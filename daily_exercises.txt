isolation_forest.py
    1) Generate data in two clusters and some outliers
    2) Split into a training and test set
    3) Using the training set fit IsolationForest from sklearn
    4) Use the test set to see how well outliers were detected

    extensions:
        - Change clusters and see how this affects fitting - make clusters larger/smaller, closer together, further apart etc.

truncated_svd.py
    1) Choose 2 vectors, v_1,v_2 in R^4, to form a basis for a 2 dimensional subspace V
    2) Generate samples contained in V
    3) Use TruncatedSVD from sklearn to find a map of V onto R^2
    4) Transform sample using map
    5) Evaluate how well TruncatedSVD preserved integrity of sample

    extensions:
        - Add an error term to samples in V - see how this affects how well the map performs

mixture_model.py
    1)

    extensions:
        - Add outliers - see how this affects the fitting
        - Move clusters closer together/ further apart - see how this affects the fitting
        - Try adding another cluster - maybe joining cluster - see how this affects the fitting
